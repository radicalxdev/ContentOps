- context: "This introduction sequence welcomes learners to the quest and presents\
    \ a scenario where they join a new team and face challenges due to poor documentation.\
    \ The initial screen engages learners by asking how they would tackle the situation,\
    \ offering three options: analyzing code independently, consulting colleagues,\
    \ or beginning to document their understanding. Each approach is explored in subsequent\
    \ screens, emphasizing the importance of proper documentation in reducing errors,\
    \ enhancing collaboration, and retaining knowledge. The screens provide insights\
    \ into the benefits of comprehensive documentation, including efficient onboarding,\
    \ reduced errors, easier maintenance, enhanced collaboration, and long-term knowledge\
    \ retention. They also highlight the challenges developers face in maintaining\
    \ documentation, such as time constraints, lack of expertise, and difficulty in\
    \ capturing tacit knowledge. The module preview introduces GitHub Copilot as a\
    \ tool to improve documentation workflows, outlining its features and benefits.\
    \ Learners are then asked about their familiarity with GitHub Copilot, and depending\
    \ on their response, they are guided through the relevant next steps. Finally,\
    \ examples of GitHub Copilot\u2019s documentation features are provided, illustrating\
    \ how it can assist with code comments, README files, API documentation, and error\
    \ explanations, ultimately making the codebase more understandable and maintainable."

          A new developer quickly understands the codebase through comprehensive documentation,
          accelerating their integration and reducing the need for extensive guidance
          from team members.

          - **Reduced Errors and Easier Maintenance**:

          Well-documented code allows developers to understand the impact of changes,
          preventing errors and enabling more efficient debugging, thus reducing technical
          debt.

          - **Enhanced Collaboration**:

          Clear documentation ensures consistent understanding among team members,
          minimizing miscommunications, merge conflicts, and duplicated efforts, leading
          to higher productivity.

          - **Knowledge Retention**:

          Proper documentation preserves critical knowledge, enabling remaining team
          members to maintain and update the software efficiently, ensuring long-term
          project sustainability even with team changes.

          enough time to create comprehensive documentation.

          - **Lack of Expertise**: Documentation is a skill that not all developers
          possess, making it challenging for them to create clear, accurate, and useful
          documentation.

          - **Difficulty in Capturing Tacit Knowledge**: Some aspects of a project,
          like design decisions or problem-solving strategies, may not be easily captured
          in documentation, particularly when it''s created manually.


          Generative AI tools like GitHub Copilot can alleviate these challenges by
          quickly generating clear, accurate, and comprehensive documentation. This

          Instead of "Help with error", try "How do I fix the `TypeError` in the `fetchData()`
          function when it receives `null` from the API?".

          - **Break Down Complex Questions**: If you have a multi-part question, break

          1. **Contextual Autocompletion**: GitHub Copilot suggests comments and documentation
          snippets as you type, based on the context of your code.

          2. **Code Review Integration**: During code reviews, use GitHub Copilot
          to generate explanatory comments for new or modified code, enhancing understanding
          and feedback.

          3. **Documentation Templates**: Create custom templates for common documentation
          patterns, and use GitHub Copilot to fill in the specifics for each code
          segment.

          4. **Refinement Prompts**: After generating initial documentation, use follow-up
          prompts to refine and expand the comments, ensuring they are comprehensive
          and clear.

          5. **Example-Based Prompts**: Provide examples or patterns to GitHub Copilot,
          and ask it to generate similar documentation for other parts of your code.

          6. **Code Summarization**: Use GitHub Copilot to generate a summary comment
          for an entire function or class, capturing its overall purpose and key operations.

          7. **Tagging and Annotations**: Request GitHub Copilot to include specific
          tags or annotations within the comments to align with your project''s documentation
          standards.

          8. **Real-time Collaboration**: During pair programming sessions, use GitHub
          Copilot to generate and discuss documentation in real-time, ensuring both
          developers have a shared understanding of the code.
