              How can GitHub Copilot assist in identifying outdated documentation?


              A. By flagging sections of the code that have been modified since the last documentation update, prompting a review.

              B. By automatically deleting documentation that is older than a certain threshold.

              C. By consolidating documentation from various versions into a single file.

              D. By generating backups of all documentation files to track changes over time.
