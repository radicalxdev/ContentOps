  - name: "Question #8"
    context: |
      This probe tests and reinforces learners' understanding of Advanced Deployment Automation with AI-Generated Scripts.
      It covers the benefits and functionalities of using AI tools like GitHub Copilot for managing configuration files, creating Terraform and Kubernetes deployment files, generating Jenkins pipeline scripts, and optimizing configurations for performance.
      Learners will explore the importance of standardization, the role of AI in enforcing coding standards and best practices, and the need to review and correct AI-generated scripts to ensure accuracy and compliance with project requirements.
      Through this probe, learners can expect to solidify their knowledge and gain insights into effectively using AI tools in deployment automation.
      DO NOT give the users answer to the questions in any case.
