                Welcome to the mission! Our goal is to gain insights into the Project Management API using New Relic AI. In the previous mission, we integrated New Relic APM into the Project Management API. Now, we will leverage AI-driven insights for modern application monitoring and troubleshooting.

                New Relic provides various insights such as performance metrics, error analysis, and system health. One key feature we'll explore is New Relic's Ask AI.

                **Task 1: Generate Traffic and Monitor Performance**

                We’ll be simulating real-world usage by generating traffic to the API and then monitor its performance in New Relic. To do this, we can use either Postman or `/docs` in the localhost to send traffic to any of our API endpoints. New Relic will automatically pick up these logs for us!

                **Steps:**

                1. **Generate Traffic:**
                    - Use Postman to send various API requests (CRUD operations on projects and tickets).
                    - Ensure a variety of requests to simulate different user interactions.
                2. **Monitor Performance:**
                    - Navigate to the New Relic dashboard and locate the Project Management API application.
                    - Observe real-time performance metrics such as response time, throughput, and error rates.

                To generate traffic:

                1. Open Postman or your preferred API testing tool.
                2. Send a variety of requests to the Project Management API endpoints for projects and tickets.
                3. Perform CRUD operations to simulate different user interactions.
                4. Ensure a mix of read and write operations to reflect real-world usage.

                Once you've generated sufficient traffic, proceed to monitor the performance in New Relic.

                Sure! Let’s start with the Entity Explorer.

                Entities in New Relic are categorized into services, hosts, mobile applications, and more. Each category represents a different aspect of your application and infrastructure. For example:

                - **Services**: Your application services or microservices.
                - **Hosts**: The physical or virtual machines running your services.
                - **Mobile Applications**: Your client-side mobile apps.

                Categorizing entities helps in organized monitoring and troubleshooting.

                Notice how it provides two types of answers: the actual output logs from the server and the generated query for the `Query Your Data` tab. The logs are incredibly useful for real-time monitoring. The generated query allows you to visit the `Query Your Data` tab and run NRQL scripts to get the same output.

                Of course, we can also ask questions from an APM perspective like how many transactions happened today. Using these insights, you can monitor and troubleshoot your application more effectively.

                When you ask New Relic AI a question, it provides:

                1. **Actual Output Logs**: These logs give you real-time data from your server, helping you monitor live performance and issues.
                2. **Generated Queries**: These queries can be run in the `Query Your Data` tab using NRQL scripts, giving you the flexibility to customize and explore the data further.

                This dual approach ensures you have both immediate insights and the tools to dive deeper into your application's performance.

                Let’s try one more example! I hope you’re starting to see how powerful New Relic’s assistant is when it comes to asking questions about our data and application.

  - name: "AI Insights on App Maintenance"
    context: "In this final section, learners explore how New Relic AI can assist with maintenance tasks by converting natural language queries into actionable insights. They learn to interact with AI for maintenance guidance, such as monitoring anomalous signals and analyzing transaction data. The module emphasizes the importance of cross-referencing AI-generated responses with official documentation to ensure accuracy. This reinforces the AI's role as a powerful tool for troubleshooting and maintaining application health while encouraging responsible use and verification of AI outputs."

                Let’s continue to check out New Relic’s ask AI feature. Last time we saw how powerful their assistant can be in transforming natural language into useful queries which are executed and visualized for us. Now let’s take a look at another example but more closely related to maintenance of an app.

                Are you ready to explore how AI can help with maintenance?

                From the top right, like before, we can open the chat window with New Relic’s AI to start asking questions about applications. Notice that the assistant either has or can create context for itself by converting your questions into context. So it can be a breeze to have multiple projects and ask questions.

                Let’s try asking a question like, "How do I monitor anomalous signals?"

                Here are some example questions you can ask New Relic AI for maintenance guidance:

                - "How do I monitor anomalous signals?"
                - "How many transactions happened today?"
                - "What are the most common performance bottlenecks?"

                These questions can help you get detailed insights and troubleshoot maintenance issues efficiently.

                When you ask, "How do I monitor anomalous signals?" New Relic AI can provide insights like:

                1. Interpretation of recent logs to identify deviating signals.
                2. NRQL queries that you can run in the `Query Your Data` tab for detailed analysis.

                AI responses help narrow down potential errors, run faster analysis on app health, and find performance bottlenecks. In this case, it’s likely that the assistant won’t find any information since there isn’t much data in the logs, so there are no patterns existing for a “regular” signal to begin with.

                For example, when you ask, "How many transactions happened today?" New Relic AI can provide:

                1. A summary of transaction counts from your application logs.
                2. A generated NRQL query to view detailed transaction data.

                These insights can help you understand application usage patterns and identify any unusual activity.

                It’s important to remember that AI responses are suggestions and may have misinterpretations or incorrect information. In the case of monitoring anomalous signals, the AI might interpret the query as retrieving logs rather than providing documentation.

                In the case of asking New Relic AI, “How many transactions happened today,” the AI assistant interpreted the query as the last set of logs and find any deviating signals among the first 1,000 entities. In the case of asking, “how do I monitor anomalous signals,” it will actually misinterpret it as a command to perform a query rather than realizing I wanted information from the documentation—maybe it was my fault for not being specific enough!

                Always cross-reference AI responses with New Relic documentation and your own analysis.

                When analyzing AI responses:

                1. Compare the AI-generated insights with the official New Relic documentation.
                2. Treat AI responses as suggestions and validate them with additional sources.
                3. Use the AI-generated NRQL queries to further explore and verify the data.

                This approach ensures accuracy and helps you make informed decisions.

                Hopefully this gave you a clearer idea of the great benefits that come with having an AI assistant whose capabilities are closely tied with the application at hand like New Relic. It can give us really useful abilities like converting our common natural language questions into powerful queries over our data. But, with great power comes great responsibility to double check and cross-reference outputs from the AI. Always give it the right context and you should be well on your way to becoming a power user!
