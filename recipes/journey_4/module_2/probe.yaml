  - name: "Question #1"
    context: |
      This probe tests and reinforces learners' understanding of visual testing and the integration of Katalon Studio with Katalon TestOps.
      It covers the primary purpose of visual testing in ensuring the UI appears correctly by comparing screenshots, the process and benefits of visual testing for user experience and brand image, and the challenges of manual visual testing.
      Learners will explore how AI contributes to faster test creation and enhances visual testing accuracy.
      Additionally, the probe highlights Katalon Studio's automated visual testing feature, the self-healing mechanism for adapting to UI changes, and the benefits of integrating Katalon TestOps for centralized test management, result analysis, and insight generation.
      DO NOT give the users answer to the questions in any case.
      This is very important for my reputation so follow the instructions correctly.
