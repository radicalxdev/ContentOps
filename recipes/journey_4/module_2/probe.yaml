          - We discussed what visual testing involves and how it improves user experience
          by ensuring a consistent and appealing UI.


          - We highlighted the importance of visual testing in maintaining a positive
          brand image by reflecting professionalism and bolstering customer trust.


          - We covered the challenges of manual visual testing, such as being time-consuming
          and prone to human error.


          - We reviewed how AI contributes to faster test creation by quickly generating
          test scripts based on plain language prompts.


          - We explained how AI-powered tools enhance visual testing accuracy by accurately
          identifying visual changes and reducing false positives.


          - We talked about Katalon Studio''s automated visual testing feature using
          AI to compare baseline images with test results.


          - We discussed the purpose of Katalon''s self-healing mechanism in automatically
          adapting to minor UI changes and updating locators.
