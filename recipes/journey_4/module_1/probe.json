Instead of relying on fixed wait times that can lead to either unnecessary delays or test failures, Smart Wait ensures that the test steps proceed only when the required conditions are met. This intelligent handling of wait times reduces the likelihood of flakiness in automated tests and increases their reliability and precision.",
