  - name: "Module Quiz & Knowledge Check"
    context: "This quiz module assesses learners' understanding of how to effectively use GitHub Copilot for generating and refining project documentation. It emphasizes the importance of providing detailed prompts, reviewing and tailoring Copilot's suggestions to meet project-specific requirements, and ensuring the generated documentation is accurate and complete. Key topics covered include identifying outdated documentation, documenting complex algorithms and external libraries, using chat commands for context, and improving collaboration through clear and consistent documentation. The quiz also highlights the potential limitations of relying solely on Copilot and the need for human oversight to maintain documentation quality and project standards. \n\nSPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS: Given that this is a quiz, learners can ask general questions to the user, but you the instructor are to only give hints."
