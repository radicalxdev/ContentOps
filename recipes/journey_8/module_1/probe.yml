                In the context of Generative AI, hallucination refers to the phenomenon where the AI model generates content that appears to be valid and coherent but is actually incorrect, misleading, or nonsensical. These outputs can be problematic as they may be difficult to distinguish from accurate information, leading to potential misinformation or confusion. Hallucination typically occurs due to limitations in the model's training data or inherent biases.

                Validating AI-generated outputs is crucial to ensure that the information or content produced by the AI is accurate, reliable, and suitable for the intended purpose. Since AI models can produce erroneous or biased outputs, validation helps identify and correct these issues before the content is used in critical applications. This step is essential to maintain the quality, credibility, and usefulness of AI-generated results.

                **Question:** How does Eraser AI improve the process of generating visual documentation?

                a) By requiring manual input for each diagram.

                b) By automating the generation of diagrams from code.

                c) By ignoring code changes.

                d) By avoiding visual aids.

                Eraser AI improves the process of generating visual documentation by automating the creation of diagrams directly from code. This automation ensures that visual documentation is always up-to-date with the latest code changes, reducing the manual effort required to produce and maintain diagrams. Accurate and current visual documentation helps developers and stakeholders understand the system architecture, data flow, and relationships between components, enhancing communication and collaboration.
