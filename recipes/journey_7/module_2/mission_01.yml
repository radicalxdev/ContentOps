                To implement this new feature, a team member writes a function using a heap data structure. Since you didn't write the code, you find it challenging to understand how this new feature will interact with the other components in the automated ticket assignment tool. Fortunately, Eraser AI excels at creating architectural diagrams from code snippets. Enter the following prompt and the new feature's code in the Diagram Edit Prompt:

                ```python
                Add a feature to assign multiple people to a single ticket into the diagram.
                Use the following code to understand how the new feature works:

                import heapq
                from datetime import datetime

                def schedule_projects(projects, assignees):

                    assignee_heap = [(0, assignee["name"], assignee) for assignee in assignees]
                    heapq.heapify(assignee_heap)
                    assignments = []
                    for project in projects:
                        project_assignees = []
                        assignees_per_project = (len(assignees) + 1) // 2
                        for _ in range(assignees_per_project):
                            if assignee_heap:
                                workload, assignee_name, assignee = heapq.heappop(assignee_heap)
                                project_assignees.append(assignee)
                                workload += 1
                                heapq.heappush(assignee_heap, (workload, assignee_name, assignee))
                        assignments.append({"project": project, "assignees": project_assignees})
