                ### General Best Practices

                **Leverage AI-generated starting points:** Eraser AI quickly generates initial diagrams from descriptions or code, allowing you to focus on refining rather than starting from scratch.

                **Iterate with keyboard-first approach:** Use Eraser's keyboard-first design to create and edit diagrams efficiently, speeding up the iteration process.

                **Start with clear descriptions:** Provide concise and accurate descriptions to get better initial outputs from Eraser AI.

                **Refine AI-generated outputs:** Review and refine the diagrams using your expertise to ensure accuracy.

                **Utilize streaming results:** Use real-time streaming results to adjust or stop the generation process as needed.

                **Balance detail and clarity:** Find the right balance in your prompts to avoid overwhelming the AI while producing clear, useful diagrams.

                By following these best practices, you can effectively use Eraser AI to streamline your documentation process and improve team communication.
