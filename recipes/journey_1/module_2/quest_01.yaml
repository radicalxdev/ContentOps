Unlike traditional AI systems, which are primarily designed for pattern recognition and classification, Generative AI uses deep learning techniques to produce human-like text, images, music, and even code. With Generative AI, the system is trained on a large corpus of data, which allows it to learn the patterns and relationships in the data and generate new content that is similar to the input data. This allows Generative AI systems to create content that is not only realistic but also unique and creative.\n\nWant to learn more about Generative AI?"
