                Software developers should use AI as a tool to augment, not replace, their own skills. It's essential to maintain a critical eye when evaluating AI-generated outputs. By striking a balance between AI's power and human intelligence, you can unlock the full potential of AI while managing any risks. Use your own judgement to identify potential errors, evaluate the appropriateness of the suggested solutions, and make informed decisions about using AI-generated outputs in your work.

                Here are a few ways developers can maintain critical thinking skills while working with AI:

                1. **Remain aware of limitations**: Be mindful of the limitations of AI, including potential biases in training data, limited understanding of context, and the black box nature of some AI models.
                2. **Question AI outputs**: Always question and validate AI-generated outputs. Just because the AI suggested it doesn't mean it's the best solution.
                3. **Foster collaboration**: Work collaboratively with AI to achieve the best results. Use AI as an assistant, not a replacement for human intelligence.
                4. **Be critical of the tools you select**: Not all AI tools will be the right fit for your workflow. Be mindful when selecting your tools.
