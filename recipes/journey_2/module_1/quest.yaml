                GitHub Copilot Chat generates code suggestions based on your prompts or questions. For example, if you ask Copilot to create a new method, it can provide suggestions for one or more method signatures and implementations. You can review these suggestions and accept or discard them to quickly create an initial version of your code.

                **Example**:

                ```python
                # Prompt: Create a method to calculate the average of a list of numbers
                def calculate_average(numbers):
                    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
                ```

                This process helps you develop code more quickly and accurately, especially when working with unfamiliar resources like new libraries, frameworks, or APIs.

                Prompt: Create a Node.js function to fetch data from an API using the Axios library.
                ```

                **Suggested Code**:

                ```javascript
                const axios = require('axios');

                async function fetchData(url) {
                    try {
                        const response = await axios.get(url);
                        return response.data;
                    } catch (error) {
                        console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
                        throw error;
                    }
                }
                ```

                Reviewing the suggestions can also teach you how to implement the new resources, making you more proficient with unfamiliar technologies.

                Let's break down the regular expression generated by Copilot Chat to validate email addresses:

                1. `^`: Indicates the start of a line. The email address must start here.
                2. `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+`: Matches one or more (+) of the characters inside the square brackets. Characters can be lowercase (a-z), uppercase (A-Z), numeric (0-9), or special characters (., _, %, +, -).
                3. `@`: Literal "at" symbol (@).
                4. `[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+`: Matches the domain name portion with characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, ., -).
                5. `\.`: Literal period (.) character.
                6. `[a-zA-Z]{2,}`: Matches the domain extension with two or more alphabetic characters.
                7. `$`: Indicates the end of a line. The email address must end here.

                This regex matches any string that starts with one or more alphanumeric or special characters, followed by an @ symbol, a domain name, a period, and finally two or more alphabetic characters.

                Copilot works best when it has sufficient context, just as you would provide a colleague with context when asking for help. Here's how you can provide context to Copilot:

                1. **Open Files**: Keep all related files open to help Copilot see the bigger picture.
                2. **Top-Level Comments**: Add high-level comments to describe the overall purpose of your code.
                3. **Appropriate Includes**: Manually set the necessary includes or module references for your project.

              content: |
                Adding a top-level comment in your code file can help Copilot understand the overall context of your code.

                **Example**:

                ```python
                # This module handles user authentication and authorization.
                class UserAuth:
                    def __init__(self, user_data):
                        self.user_data = user_data
                ```

                A brief, high-level comment at the top of your file can guide Copilot to provide better suggestions.

                Using meaningful function names helps Copilot understand the purpose of your functions and provide more accurate suggestions.

                **Example**:

                ```python
                def fetch_user_data(user_id):
                    # Fetches data for a given user ID
                    pass
                ```

                Avoid generic names like `fetchData()` and use descriptive names like `fetch_user_data()` to help Copilot generate relevant code.

              content: |
                Adding specific and well-scoped comments to your functions can help Copilot generate more accurate code suggestions.

                **Example**:

                ```python
                def calculate_total_price(items):
                    """
                    Calculate the total price of items in the cart.

                    Parameters:
                    items (list): List of items where each item is a dictionary with 'price' and 'quantity'.

                    Returns:
                    float: Total price of all items.
                    """
                    pass
                ```

                These comments provide Copilot with additional context about the function's purpose and parameters.

                One trick to get Copilot on the right page is to copy and paste desirable code samples into an open editor tab. This helps Copilot understand the style and structure you want to emulate.

                **Example**:

                ```python
                # Sample code for using the latest version of a library
                import new_library

                def new_function():
                    return new_library.perform_action()
                ```

                After Copilot generates code that matches your goal, you can delete the sample code. This approach is particularly useful for ensuring Copilot uses the latest library versions.
