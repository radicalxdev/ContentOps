    context: "In this mission, learners are introduced to improving code quality using GitHub Copilot Chat. They start by understanding the learning objectives, which include demonstrating the use of chat participants and variables for effective prompts, and specifying code quality aspects for improvement. Learners are then guided to prepare the repository by cloning it from GitHub, creating environment files, and activating the shell script to set up the development or production environment. This setup prepares them for the upcoming exercises where they will use Copilot Chat to generate and evaluate suggestions for code quality improvements."

                Hello, {username}! Welcome to the 'Improve Code Quality using GitHub Copilot Chat' mission. This exercise focuses on using GitHub Copilot Chat to generate suggestions for improving code quality in a sample application. Remember, the suggestions from Copilot do not represent best practices or comprehensive solutions. Use your judgment and expertise to evaluate and implement these suggestions. Ready to start?

                In this mission, you'll use GitHub Copilot to generate suggestions that help improve code quality in a sample application. The learning objectives are:
                - Demonstrate when to use chat participants and chat variables to help specify an outer context for effective prompts.
                - Specify code quality aspects for improvement to develop effective prompts.

                Let's prepare the repository for this exercise. Follow these steps:
                1. Clone the GitHub repository found at: https://github.com/alfred-ai-co/Improve-Code-Quality-with-Copilot
                2. Create a `dev.env` and `prod.env` file based on the `env.example`, setting the variable `APP_ENV` to ‚Äúdev‚Äù or ‚Äúprod‚Äù respectively.
                3. In the terminal, activate the shell script `start.sh` with the command: `/start.sh <args>`, where you may set `dev` or `prod` as the argument. By default, a `dev` environment is instantiated.

  - name: "Develop Prompts for Copilot Chat"
    context: "In this part of the mission, learners focus on developing prompts for GitHub Copilot Chat to enhance code quality by improving readability, maintainability, and modularity. They are instructed to open the app/db_models/base.py file and review the code, which now includes Kanban Board models. Learners are then guided to write prompts, such as asking for suggestions on improving code readability or modularity, and refactoring the selected code. After writing the prompts, they review the suggestions generated by Copilot Chat and prepare to proceed with the refactoring process. This step emphasizes the practical use of Copilot Chat in identifying and implementing code quality improvements."

They start by prompting Copilot for suggestions on implementing these principles to enhance modularity and maintainability. After reviewing suggestions, such as creating a DatabaseOperations class and handling special CRUD requirements through subclassing a BaseCRUD class, learners gain insights into effective code refactoring. The mission concludes with a summary, emphasizing the importance of reviewing and evaluating Copilot's suggestions before implementation, showcasing how Copilot can assist in enhancing code readability, maintainability, and modularity."

                But if any db item has special requirements for a CRUD operation, would that mean it would be difficult to handle?
