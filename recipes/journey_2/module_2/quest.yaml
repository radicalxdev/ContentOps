          specific, and focused. For example, if you want to improve code quality,
          you might create a prompt that asks GitHub Copilot to suggest refactoring
          updates to enhance the modularity of a specific class or method. Effective
          prompts help GitHub Copilot understand your goals and provide relevant suggestions.
          When GitHub Copilot receives prompts that are defined too broadly or vaguely,
          it may not be able to generate useful suggestions. We extensively covered
