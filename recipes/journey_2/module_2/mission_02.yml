    context: "In this mission, learners focus on improving code reliability and performance using GitHub Copilot Chat. They start by understanding the learning objectives, which include collaborating with Copilot to enhance code reliability and implementing asynchronous APIs for better performance. Learners are guided to prepare the repository by cloning it from GitHub, creating environment files, and activating the shell script to set up the development or production environment. This setup prepares them for the upcoming exercises, where they will use Copilot Chat to generate and evaluate suggestions for improving code reliability and performance."

                Hello, {username}! Welcome to the 'Improve Code Reliability and Performance using GitHub Copilot Chat' mission. This training focuses on using GitHub Copilot Chat to generate suggestions for improving code reliability and performance in a sample application. Remember, the suggestions from Copilot do not represent best practices or comprehensive solutions. Use your judgment and expertise to evaluate and implement these suggestions. Ready to start?

                Developers should strive for a balance between code reliability and performance. A successful balance produces the following mutually beneficial results:
                - Applications meet functional requirements
                - Applications that deliver a seamless and efficient user experience.
                That's why in this mission, you'll use GitHub Copilot to generate suggestions that help improve code reliability and performance in a sample application. The learning objectives are to demonstrate how to collaborate with Copilot to implement code reliability and use Copilot to implement asynchronous API for improving code performance.

                Code reliability refers to the likelihood that software functions correctly under specific conditions and for a certain period of time. Improving code reliability helps to ensure that your software performs as expected and meets user requirements. In this exercise, you use Github Copilot Chat to generate suggestions that help you improve code reliability and performance in a sample application.

                Let's prepare the repository for this exercise. Follow these steps:
                1. Clone the GitHub repository found at: https://github.com/alfred-ai-co/Improve-Code-Quality-with-Copilot
                2. Create a `dev.env` and `prod.env` file based on the `env.example`, setting the variable `APP_ENV` to “dev” or “prod” respectively.
                3. In the terminal, activate the shell script `start.sh` with the command: `/start.sh <args>`, where you may set `dev` or `prod` as the argument. By default, a `dev` environment is instantiated.

  - name: "Collaborate with Copilot to implement Code Reliability"
    context: "In this segment of the mission, learners focus on collaborating with GitHub Copilot to enhance code reliability. They start by prompting Copilot to analyze and suggest improvements for code reliability, including error handling and type management. After reviewing the suggestions, they specifically focus on handling database errors with SQLAlchemy. Copilot provides advanced methods such as transaction management and connection pooling. Learners then prompt Copilot for a detailed implementation strategy to handle SQLAlchemy exceptions, observing how Copilot suggests modifications and demonstrates specific strategies based on the project's configuration. This exercise emphasizes the practical use of Copilot in improving code reliability through collaborative problem-solving."

                Similar to code reliability, we can have conversations with Copilot to improve the performance of our code. To the experienced eye, the routes defined in the current API implementation are synchronous events within the FastAPI server, meaning concurrent requests will be done one-by-one and expensive requests will require the rest of the line to wait.
                
                ```python
                @workspace How can I improve my program's performance by managing synchronous and asynchronous events in the API?

                Notice how Copilot recommends the asynchronous handlers for all of the routes such as projects.py where it can handle multiple requests at the same time without waiting for other requests to complete. In our case, because we are using SQLAlchemy which does not natively support asynchronous operations, this would not be a major change for the app's performance. But this would allow the API to handle multiple requests by returning a coroutine per route and allow the API to accept requests while processing them at the same time.
